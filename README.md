# My Bookshelf - React Application

In this project I created a Single-Page-Application([SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)) using React. The application is a digital bookshelf using Google Books API. 

Among many advantages of React application developments, simplified scripting, component-based architecture, faster rendering, stable code structure, SEO-enabled, and handy developer tools are some of them. 

The bookshelf app has three main pages, Discover Books, My Bookshelf, and Shopping List, which the user can access directly from the navigation bar. 

## Discover Books:
In the "Discover Books" page, the user is able to search the entire Google Books API database . The result will be displayed underneath the search bar. For each book, the book information along with 3 buttons are displayed. These three buttons are "Read More", "Add to Shelf", and "Add to Wish List". 


## My Bookshelf
 This page contains all the books added to the shelf using the buttons in the search page. In front of each book there is a check box to indicate if the book is already read and a button to remove the book from the shelf.

## Shopping List
This page contains all the books added to the wish list/shopping list using the buttons in the search page. In front of each book there is a check box to indicate if the book is owned already and a button to remove the book from the list.
